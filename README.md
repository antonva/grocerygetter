# grocerygetter

## IRC bot which takes strings (groceries was my original inspiration) and sticks them in a textfile.

**Usage:** python2.7 main.py <channel> [bot's nick]

Commands can be seen by typing .help.

Symlink your list directory to dropbox or your webserver and you'll never forget your grocery list again! Or something.
